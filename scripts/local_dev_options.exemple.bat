@REM this exemple file should be renamed to ksp_location.bat.
@REM ksp_location.bat is git ignored and therefore can contains informations depending on dev local machine

@REM set your own KSP2_LOCATION and rename me to ksp_location.bat (git ignored)
@REM ps : don't use "", no \ final
set KSP2_LOCATION=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2
