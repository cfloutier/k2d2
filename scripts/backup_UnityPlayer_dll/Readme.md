This directory is used to store unity engine dll (debug or release)

* debug UnityPlayer.dll is hard to find

the current Unity Version is 2022.3.5f1
you have to install the UnityEditor first of course

I've create an simple Unity Editor project, and build it in devellopement mode. in the root folder there where the debug UnityPlayer.dll

copy it to this folder and rename it to `UnityPlayer_debug.dll`

* release UnityPlayer.dll can be found in ksp2 game folder  `KSP2Location\UnityPlayer.dll`

copy it to this folder and rename it to `UnityPlayer_release.dll`
